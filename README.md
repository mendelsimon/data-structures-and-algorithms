## Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains my exploration in implementing common data structures and algorithms with clean code and best practices. Each module contains a complete data structure or algorithm. Everything is type-annotated, and there is 100% test coverage.

So far, this project contains:
 - Data Structures
    - Linked Lists
